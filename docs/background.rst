Nova Labs announced events and registered participants on Meetup.com until
Meetup lost the ability to collect registration fees on November 10, 2020.
To replace Meetup, Nova Labs selected Wild Apricot to process registrations and
collect fees.
Meetup2apricot copies events from Meetup to Wild Apricot.

Meetup Ends Support for Registration Fees
-----------------------------------------

.. index:: WePay

Payment processor `WePay terminated its services for Meetup`_ on November 10, 2020.
Meetup hopes to have a new event fee system in early 2021.
When Meetup provided a one-month notice to its customers, Nova Labs reviewed
options for paid event registration, selecting Wild Apricot.

Wild Apricot Concept of Operation
---------------------------------

Beginning November 10, 2020, Meetup events will be mirrored on Wild Apricot.
The Nova Labs Events Team will add links from Meetup events to their Wild
Apricot counterparts.
Members and others who discover events via Meetup can click the provided link
to view and register for the same event in Wild Apricot.
The Nova Labs web site links will direct members and visitors directly to
events in Wild Apricot.
Event registration payments will be collected and tracked by Wild Apricot.

The Nova Labs Information Technology Team initiated several projects to support
the rapid transition to Wild Apricot.

* *Spaceman2apricot* to load and synchronize member data with the existing
  *Spaceman* maker space management program.
* *Meetup2apricot* to load events from Meetup to Wild Apricot.
* Wild Apricot web site layout and styling.
* Many other smaller changes.
